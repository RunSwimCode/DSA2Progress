# Here is Section A and the sample set of steps:
# A) Package data steps:
# 1-Create HashTable data structure (See C950 - Webinar-1 - Letâ€™s Go Hashing webinar)
# 2-Create Package and Truck objects and have packageCSV and distanceCSV and addressCSV files ready
# 3-Create loadPackageData(HashTable) to
# - read packages from packageCSV file (see C950 - Webinar-2 - Getting Greedy, who moved my data  webinar)
# - update Package object
# - insert Package object into HashTable with the key=PackageID and Item=Package

# Section B: Now, I need to upload the distances information by creating a 2D list w/addresses and distances
# B) Distance data steps:
# B.1) Upload Distances:

# 5-Define loadDistanceData(distanceData) to read distanceCSV file
# - read distances from distanceCSV file; row by row
# - append row to distanceData (two-dimensional list. See C950 WGUPS Distance Table Metrics)
# B.2) Upload Addresses:
# 6-Create addressData List
# 7-Define loadAddressData(addressData) to read addressCSV file
# - read only addresses from addressCSV file
# - append address to addressData.


# Get the address data from the csv file

# 8-Define distanceBetween(address1, address2)
